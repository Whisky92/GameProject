# About the Game

There is a board, on which we have some rectangles, circles and empty cells.
From the top-left corner of the table you have to move the figure to the bottom-left corner.
We can move on the table both horizontally and vertically, by doing 2 or 3 steps in each turn. But in the first turn we can only make 2 steps.
We can't step on rectangles (dark cells), and stepping on a circle results in a step forward or backward depending on the number of steps we make.
